We have our first 3D print!

After taking a simple scan of a rucksack, weâ€™ve produced a scaled down
3D printed version. The green shows a lower resolution, and the orange
higher. We also produced a 3D print of a gear system, which can
hopefully be used to slow down the rotation speed of the turntable.

The lower resolution prints took only \~30 mins, whereas the higher
resolution print took roughly 2 and a half hours!

The final results of the low resolution prints came out very nicely as
seen below. Note that the support structure from the prints has yet to
be removed!
