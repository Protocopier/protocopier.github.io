We also did some interviews of the members of the different team, questions being about what they think about the project, how much fun they had working on it, the possible challenges they faced and overcome. They also shared their point of views about HiPEDS and its collaboration with companies such as Dyson and Imperial College London in general. Find those interviews by following our Youtube channel and prepare to be amazed!
