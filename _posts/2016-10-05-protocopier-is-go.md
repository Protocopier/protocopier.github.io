Today we had our first official meeting! Exciting stuff.
For all you Protocopier enthusiasts out there, he is a short breakdown of what happened.

We met at 10:00am in the wonderful CDT space to put our heads together and think about the general approach we wanted to take.

As you can see, lot of whiteboards, lots of puzzled faces, lots of thinking.

The main problems we thought about were:

- Is a rotating table with a fixed camera better? Or a free camera?
- What conditions are best to maximise performance of fusion algorithm
- Are there any external tools that could facilitate with the problem?
