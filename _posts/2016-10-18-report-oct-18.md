Today, the holding mount for the Kinect arrived - thanks to Amazon
Premium :).

The hardware team made a base holder with the engine and rotating plate.

The team also 3D printed mounts to hold the rotating part and fixed part
used for background removal.

PICTURES TO COME

The printing team also decided to do a bit of hardware by adding a
holder onto which the object to print will be placed. The parts were cut
out of wood boards using the cutter from the Hackspace and glued
together.![](/img/blog/18th/media/image10.jpg)![](/img/blog/18th/media/image07.jpg)![](/img/blog/18th/media/image03.jpg)

The processing team also worked on cropping scan within a cylinder

A lot of work has been done today and hopefully, tomorrow everything
will fit together!
