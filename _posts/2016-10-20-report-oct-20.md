Over the past few days, the hardware, scanning and printing teams have
made wonders!

After more than 10h, our first scanned object was printed and looks
bright!

The final hardware parameters are now fully defined by the scanning team
to obtain optimal mesh of any objects. They tried on objects of
different forms and shapes and it looks
good!![image](/img/blog/20th/media/image10.png){: style="width: 22em"}![image](/img/blog/20th/media/image08.png){: style="width: 22em"}![image](/img/blog/20th/media/image11.png){: style="width: 22em"}![image](/img/blog/20th/media/image07.png){: style="width: 22em"}

Now, everyone is focused on doing the posters!
