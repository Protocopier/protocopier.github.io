***October 20th ***

Over the past few days, the hardware, scanning and printing teams have
made wonders!

The final hardware parameters are now fully defined for optimal scanning
of any objects. They tried on objects of different forms and
shapes.![](/img/blog/20th/media/image08.png)![](/img/blog/20th/media/image07.png)![](/img/blog/20th/media/image09.png)![](/img/blog/20th/media/image05.png)

Now, everyone is focused on doing the posters!
